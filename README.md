Here are the steps I used to create and optimize a four-qubit pulse sequence, introduce noise, and calibrate the pulse gates for a quantum computer using Qiskit:
1. Create a Four-Qubit Pulse Sequence:
○ Set up a quantum circuit with four qubits.
○ Apply multiple quantum gates, including Hadamard, Pauli's exclusion gates, and
others to create the desired logical circuit.
2. Introduce Noise Using the Noise Model:
○ Import or create a noise model that describes the errors and imperfections in the quantum computer.
○ Apply the noise model to the entire quantum system.
3. Concentrate Noise on Qubit 1 and correct a bit-flip error using Three-bit code:
○ Adjust the noise model to concentrate noise on qubit 1.
○ This step is essential to analyze error mitigation and error correction specifically
for qubit 1.
○ Three-bit code is used to correct a bit-flip error.
4. Map Logical Gates to Pulse Gates:
○ Define a mapping that associates logical circuit gates (e.g., X gate) with Qiskit
Pulse programs called Schedules.
○ This mapping is referred to as calibration.
5. Calibrate Pulse Gates with Gaussian Curves:
○ Configure the pulse schedule for each gate using Gaussian curves.
○ Specify parameters such as amplitude, duration, and other relevant parameters.
○ The goal is to ensure that the calibration faithfully implements the logical
operation it is mapped from (e.g., X gate calibration driving |0> to |1>).
6. Optimize the Circuit:
○ Use an in-built transpiler in Qiskit to optimize the quantum circuit.
○ The transpiler helps in improving the circuit's efficiency and minimizing errors.
7. Apply post-measurement error correction:
○ Utilize HAMMER to reconstruct the noisy output probability distribution.
○ Exploits the Hamming structure of incorrect outcomes to boost the likelihood of
the correct outcomes.
